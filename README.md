# Uber Data Engineering & Analytics Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building a data engineering pipeline to analyze Uber trip data. The pipeline extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data from a public dataset to derive meaningful insights about ride patterns, peak times, fare distribution, and more. The project demonstrates the use of modern cloud-based tools and platforms such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), BigQuery, and Looker Studio, along with the open-source data pipeline tool, Mage.ai.

## Dataset Used

We used the **TLC Trip Record Data**, which includes records of yellow and green taxi trips in New York City. This dataset captures various fields such as:

- **Pick-up and Drop-off Dates/Times**
- **Pick-up and Drop-off Locations**
- **Trip Distances**
- **Itemized Fares**
- **Rate Types**
- **Payment Types**
- **Driver-Reported Passenger Counts**

## Project Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fab22e91-fffa-42be-af74-e41bcad1f602)

This project employs a cloud-based architecture:

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for storage and computation.
- **Google Storage** for storing raw data files.
- **Compute Instance** for running ETL jobs.
- **BigQuery** for data warehousing and analysis.
- **Looker Studio** for data visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
  - **Google Storage** for data storage.
  - **Compute Instance** for processing.
  - **BigQuery** for querying and storing processed data.
  - **Looker Studio** for business intelligence and visualization.
- **Data Pipeline Tool:** [Mage.ai](https://www.mage.ai/) (an alternative to Apache Airflow)

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Set Up Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

- **Read about GCP**: Familiarize yourself with the main components of GCP, particularly Google Storage, Compute Instances, and BigQuery.
- **Create a New Project**: In the GCP Console, create a new project, activate the necessary resources, and create a storage bucket for your data.

### 2. Fetch and Explore the Dataset

- **Download Data**: Go to the NYC TLC website and download the required data. Use the [data dictionary](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf) to understand field names and their descriptions.
- **Store Data**: Upload the dataset to Google Storage.

### 3. Data Modeling

- **Fact and Dimension Tables**: Design your data model using fact and dimension tables. This allows efficient querying in BigQuery.
  
  Example code for merging tables:
  
  ```python
  fact_table = df.merge(passenger_count_dim, left_on='trip_id', right_on='passenger_count_id') \
               .merge(trip_distance_dim, left_on='trip_id', right_on='trip_distance_id') \
               .merge(rate_code_dim, left_on='trip_id', right_on='rate_code_id') \
               .merge(pickup_location_dim, left_on='trip_id', right_on='pickup_location_id') \
               .merge(dropoff_location_dim, left_on='trip_id', right_on='dropoff_location_id')\
               .merge(datetime_dim, left_on='trip_id', right_on='datetime_id') \
               .merge(payment_type_dim, left_on='trip_id', right_on='payment_type_id') \
               [['trip_id','VendorID', 'datetime_id', 'passenger_count_id',
                 'trip_distance_id', 'rate_code_id', 'store_and_fwd_flag', 'pickup_location_id', 'dropoff_location_id',
                 'payment_type_id', 'fare_amount', 'extra', 'mta_tax', 'tip_amount', 'tolls_amount',
                 'improvement_surcharge', 'total_amount']]
  ```

### 4. Data Cleaning

- **Convert DateTime Fields**: Convert date and time fields from object type to datetime for analysis:
  
  ```python
  df['tpep_pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['tpep_pickup_datetime'])
  df['tpep_dropoff_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['tpep_dropoff_datetime'])
  ```

### 5. Set Up the ETL Pipeline Using Mage.ai

- **Install Dependencies**: SSH into your Compute Instance on GCP and install the necessary dependencies.
  
  ```bash
  pip install mage-ai pandas
  ```

- **Start Mage.ai Project**:
  
  ```bash
  mage start project_name
  ```
  
- **Access Mage.ai**: After running the command, you'll get a 4-digit port number. Update your GCP project settings to allow access to this port. Then, access Mage.ai via `http://<ip-address>:<port-number>` in your browser.

### 6. Data Transformation

- **In Mage.ai**: Import data from Google Storage, perform transformations (e.g., data cleaning, normalization), and load the transformed data into BigQuery.

### 7. Data Analysis and Visualization

- **Connect BigQuery to Looker Studio**: In Looker Studio, connect to your BigQuery dataset.
- **Create Dashboards**: Design dashboards to visualize key metrics such as trip distances, fare amounts, and trip densities. You can use custom queries to highlight trends over time, peak hours, and popular locations.
  
  Example: Mapping trip distances with latitude and longitude to visualize ride patterns across the city.

## Sample Dashboards

## Insights & Analysis

From this project, you can derive several key insights:

1. **Peak Time Analysis**: Identify the busiest times for rides, which can help optimize driver availability.
2. **Fare Distribution**: Understand how fares vary based on distance, time of day, and rate types.
3. **Popular Pickup/Drop-off Locations**: Determine which locations are most frequently used, allowing for targeted marketing or operational planning.
4. **Trip Duration and Distance Analysis**: Analyze the correlation between trip duration and distance, identifying patterns that could indicate inefficiencies or potential areas for improvement.
5. **Payment Method Trends**: Track the popularity of different payment methods over time, which could inform partnerships or promotions.

By completing this project, you'll gain experience in modern data engineering practices, including cloud services, data pipeline tools, and business intelligence tools, all while extracting valuable insights from real-world data.
